# node-test

Using the GitHub API ( https://developer.github.com/v3 ), we ask that you build
a Node.js app that displays info for the open pull requests in a GitHub repository. The
interface can take whatever form you like and should accept a repository URL, for
example https://github.com/hapijs/hapi. It should display a list of open pull requests
along with the number of commits in that PR, the number of comments on the PR, and
the user that opened it.
